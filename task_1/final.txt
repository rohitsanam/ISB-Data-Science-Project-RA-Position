        Activities in our Government and Defense Services segment include the business of AAR Airlift Group, Inc. ("Airlift") and our Defense Systems and Logistics and Integrated Technologies services businesses. We acquired Airlift, formerly known as Aviation Worldwide Services, in April 2010. Airlift is a leading provider of expeditionary airlift services to the United States and other government customers. Airlift provides fixed- and rotary-wing flight operations, transporting personnel and cargo principally in support of the U.S. Department of Defense, and performs engineering and design modifications on rotary-wing aircraft for government customers. Airlift operates a fleet of customized fixed-wing and rotary-wing aircraft, principally in Afghanistan, Northern Africa and in the Western Pacific. Airlift holds FAR Part 133 and 135 certificates to operate aircraft and a FAR Part 145 certificate to operate a repair station. Airlift is also Commercial Aircraft Review Board certified with the U.S. Department of Defense. 
        Competition in the Pharmaceutical Products segment is generally from other health care and pharmaceutical companies. The search for technological innovations in pharmaceutical products is a significant aspect of competition in this segment. The introduction of new products by competitors and changes in medical practices and procedures can result in product obsolescence in the Pharmaceutical Products segment. Price can also be a factor. In addition, the substitution of generic drugs for the brand prescribed has increased competitive pressures on pharmaceutical products that are off-patent.

Although we have two principal business segments, recycling and waste services, we are primarily focusing our attention now and in the future towards our recycling business. The recycling segment collects, purchases, processes and sells stainless steel, ferrous and non-ferrous scrap metal to steel mini-mills, integrated steel makers, foundries and refineries. We purchase ferrous and non-ferrous scrap metal primarily from industrial and commercial generators of steel, iron, aluminum, copper, stainless steel and other metals as well as from scrap dealers and retail customers who deliver these materials directly to our facilities. We process scrap metal through our shredding, sorting, shearing, cutting, and baling operations. Within the recycling segment, our alloys division specializes in the purchasing, processing and sale of stainless steel, nickel-based and high-temperature alloys. Our non-ferrous scrap recycling operations consist primarily of collecting, sorting and processing various grades of copper, aluminum and brass.
